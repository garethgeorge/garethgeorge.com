GmodZ
=====

Project by TheLastPenguin


GmodZ is an attempt to bring elements of the popular games DayZ and WarZ into garry's mod.
It incorperates a long list of features including an advanced drag and drop inventory system, mysql data storage, looting, crafting, and much more.

It includes an advanced item system featuring a plethora of items including fas2 weapons, melee weapons, food items, and a full crafting system.

Incorperating one of the most advanced inventory systems currently avaliable in gmod (created by thelastpenguin project lead dev) the slot based inventory allows users to drag and drop items to and from their hotbar and even organize the contents of their inventory. 

Our advanced hotbar system overrides the default weapon selection system allowing users to retrieve items directly from their inventory creating a more immersive look and feel and bringing users away from the feel of gmod.

We have created an advanced menu framework which overrides the default Gmod menu system giving GmodZ the feeling of a unique and self contained game seperate from Garry's Mod.

Our custom rendering lib allows for the creation of circular GUI elements and huds which create a smooth and beautiful aesthetic to the gamemode.

GmodZ is developed by TheLastPenguin - lead dev with textures and map artwork provided by Hibbafrabba for use on TPS servers with the lastpenguin's discression. Usage rights may be terminated at any time by thelastpenguin, original creator and sole owner of the rights to GmodZ.


Features
--------

The Gamemode supports MySQL for user account data and inventory storage. This enables cross server support allowing us to load user data accross multiple servers.

Data encoding / decoding is accomplished using our custom data library pON created by thelastpenguin it provides faster data encode and decode rates than any current alternative by almost 15%. 

The system includes features such as an advanced loot spawning system employing probability based binary search trees to create more realistic loot distribution algorithms based on the location of each node.
Loot locations are confugured using our advanced map editing system medit_ which provides users witha GUI interface and 3d world markers for placing and editing map nodes aswell as viewing information about existing nodes in real time.
